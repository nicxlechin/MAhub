    },
    {
      "question": "How is user data collected?",
      "answer": "User data is collected via Segment SDK in the web/app. Events and user traits are tracked, then routed to downstream tools: Braze (for engagement), Amplitude/Mixpanel (for analytics), and paid channels (for dynamic audiences). Segment also handles identity resolution across devices."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I create a user segment?",
      "answer": "Segments can be created in Segment (for data routing and paid channel audiences) or Braze (for messaging). In Braze, go to Segments > Create Segment and define filters based on user attributes, behaviors, or computed traits like lead score and LTV."

      "question": "What is a Canvas in Braze?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is lead scoring and how does it work?",
      "answer": "Lead scoring assigns a 0-100 score to each user based on intent and likelihood to convert. High scores (>50) are HOT leads for direct selling, Mid scores (25-49) are WARM for soft selling, and Low scores (<25) are COLD for education and nurturing. The score is computed in Segment and synced to Braze for targeting."
    },
    {
      "question": "What tools are being deprecated?",
      "answer": "SendGrid (transactional emails) and the Webinars platform email system are being migrated to Braze. This consolidates all emails into one provider, enables better content management and reporting, and reduces engineering dependency."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I track campaign performance?",
      "answer": "Campaign performance is tracked in multiple places: Braze Dashboard for engagement metrics (opens, clicks, conversions), Clarisights for paid channel performance, Amplitude for downstream product events, and Metabase for multi-touch attribution analysis."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between MTA and MMM?",
      "answer": "MTA (Multi-Touch Attribution) provides tactical optimization with real-time, user-level data - answering which touchpoints drove conversions. MMM (Marketing Mix Modeling) provides strategic allocation guidance using aggregated, privacy-resilient data - answering how to allocate budget across channels."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does predictive churn work?",
      "answer": "Each subscriber has a predictive churn score (0-100). High churn risk users receive high renewal incentives, medium risk gets standard incentives, and low risk users don't need incentives. This is computed as a trait and synced to Braze for targeting."
